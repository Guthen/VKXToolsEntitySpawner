### ðŸ“ƒ Description
This is a tool made for **Garry's Mod** in order to *spawn random choosen entities* in a *specific shape* with or without a *spawner*.

It allows you to spawn a lot of entities, see the following list of *compatibles categories* :
+ Weapons
+ Scripted Entities
+ NPCs
+ Vehicles
+ simfphys vehicles

#### âšª Shapes
**Shapes** are used to spawn entities in a certain *geometrical form*, they only impact on *position*, *angle* and *number* of entities.

|  Shapes  |  Description  |
|----------|---------------|
|   `None`   | Spawn at a single point |
|  `Circle`  | Spawn in a standar circular shape with editable radius and entities number |
|  `Square`  | Spawn in a rectangular shape with editable wide, tall and offset between each entities |
|  `Random`  | Spawn in a circular shape with a random radius on each entity giving a random impression; the number, maximum radius, x and y ratios are editable as well; this shape might be usefull in *apocalypse/zombie-like servers* |

#### ðŸ¤– Spawners
**Spawners** are used to spawn *random choosen* entities at a fixed *delay* and a fixed *maximum of entities*. They can be *permanently saved* on the map or just *temporary*. They are usefull to spawn groups of NPCs (like zombies) or to spawn *vehicles* or *weapons* periodically for an apocalypse server for example.
